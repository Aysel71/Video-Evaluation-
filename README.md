**Repository for Experiments on Video Evaluation and Understanding**  


This repository contains a collection of experiments and tools focused on improving video understanding and developing more accurate video evaluation methods. The goal is to explore techniques that enhance machine perception of visual and temporal patterns in video content.

**Key areas of focus include:**
- Designing and testing models for video classification, captioning, and retrieval  
- Evaluating video understanding performance using both standard and custom benchmarks  
- Experimenting with multimodal approaches that combine visual, audio, and textual data  
- Exploring temporal reasoning and long-range context modeling in videos  

The experiments are part of ongoing research into building more robust and generalizable video understanding systems
